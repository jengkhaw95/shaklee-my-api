## How it works

As this project is non-official, all the data are acquired from Shaklee Malaysia website.
The project contains two major parts:

1. Server
   The server is used to host the API endpoints. (possibly docs in future)
2. Worker
   The worker is used to retrieve latest data externally in a reasonable interval of time.
   All the product data are then stored in database (`Mongodb`).
